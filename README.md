# 🛡️ SOC Agent Lab
Autonomous AI Agents for SOC Alert Triage, Detection Engineering, and Log Intelligence

---

## 📌 Overview

SOC Agent Lab is a simulated AI-powered Security Operations Center (SOC) automation platform.

This project demonstrates how autonomous AI agents can:

- Automate alert triage
- Generate detection rules
- Perform contextual log search
- Reduce false positives
- Implement feedback-driven learning loops
- Scale SOC coverage without scaling headcount

It models the architecture used by modern AI-driven SOC platforms.

## 🎯 Project Goals

This lab simulates:

- Ingestion of structured security alerts
- Embedding-based contextual retrieval (RAG)
- Agent-based reasoning workflows
- Detection-as-Code generation
- Feedback loops for confidence calibration
- Modular AI orchestration architecture

The objective is to demonstrate real-world AI engineering patterns applied to security operations.
